#### Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

#### Method 2: Add to your shell profile
```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Method 3: Create .env file
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### OpenAI API Pricing (as of 2024)
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens input, ~$0.06 per 1K tokens output
- **Typical Analysis**: ~1,500 tokens = ~$0.05-0.10 per prediction

### Cost Management Tips
1. **Monitor Usage**: Check OpenAI dashboard regularly
2. **Set Limits**: Configure spending limits in OpenAI account
3. **Test Mode**: Start with small number of predictions
4. **Optional Use**: OpenAI analysis is optional - ML predictions work without it

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Keep API Key Secret**: Never commit to version control
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Don't hardcode keys
3. **Monitor Usage**: Watch for unusual API calls
4. **Rotate Keys**: Regularly update API keys
5. **Limit Scope**: Use least-privilege access

## üö® Troubleshooting

### OpenAI Not Available
**Symptoms**: Warning message "OpenAI analysis not available"

**Solutions**:
1. Check API key is set: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. Verify key format: Should start with `sk-`
3. Check OpenAI account has credits
4. Restart the server after setting key

### API Rate Limits
**Symptoms**: Rate limit errors in logs

**Solutions**:
1. Upgrade OpenAI plan for higher limits
2. Add delays between requests
3. Monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard

### Network Issues
**Symptoms**: Connection timeouts

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify firewall settings
3. Try different network

## üìà Usage Analytics

The platform now provides three levels of analysis:

1. **Machine Learning**: Fast, local predictions (always available)
2. **Enhanced Analytics**: Population comparison and risk profiling (always available)
3. **OpenAI Analysis**: Expert clinical insights (requires API key)
